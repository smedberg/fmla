/*
The ELIGIBILITY_MATRIX constant describes which users are eligible for
which results (from the RESULTS list above.)  A user will first fill in the
survey (defined in survey_metadata.js).  The code will store the survey answers,
and attempt to discover an entry in ELIGIBILITY_MATRIX that matches the
answers that the user supplied.  It does this in order- it checks if the first
eligibility choice matches, then if the second one matches, and so forth.
A match ends the process- the first match that's encountered is the "correct"
match.
Each entry in ELIGIBILITY_MATRIX has a number of parts:
* label: a human-readable description of this entry, for use by admins
* answers: a map of question ID to expected answer.  An answer of `undefined` matches everything.
* eligibilities: a list of the names of entries in the RESULTS map that are relevant for this entry
